# Superstore Sales Analysis

This project explores Superstore sales data using Python in a Jupyter notebook environment. The dataset contains information on orders, customers, sales, profit, region, and product categories.

## Objectives

- Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize sales trends, profit by category, and regional performance.
- Compare insights derived from Python and Excel.

## Key Insights

### 1. Sales & Profit Trends
- **Sales Distribution**: Technology leads in overall sales, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies.
- **Profitability**: Despite high sales, some sub-categories like Tables have negative profit margins.
- **Shipping Mode**: Standard Class is the most used, but not always the most profitable.

### 2. Regional & Segment Analysis
- **West and East regions** perform the best in terms of profit.
- **Consumer segment** contributes significantly to both sales and profit.

### 3. Category Performance
- **Top Profitable Sub-Category**: Copiers.
- **Least Profitable**: Tables and Bookcases (often in Furniture).

### 4. Excel vs Python Comparison

| Criteria             | Excel                            | Python                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Ease of Use          | User-friendly GUI                | Requires coding knowledge              |
| Flexibility          | Limited for dynamic insights     | Highly customizable analysis           |
| Visualization        | Basic charts                     | Advanced visualizations with Seaborn   |
| Reproducibility      | Manual effort needed             | Easy to automate and reproduce         |
| Scalability          | May lag with large data          | Handles large datasets efficiently     |

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Microsoft Excel (for comparison)

## How to Run
Open the notebook file in Jupyter or Google Colab and run each cell sequentially.
